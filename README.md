## Project 1: Does Feminism change with time?


### [Project Description](doc/)


Term: Fall 2022

+ Project title: Changes in Feminism
+ This project is conducted by Shreya Sinha

+ Project summary: The project explores changes in the concept of Feminism through time. It was 1919 when women finally got the right to vote.It was in 1848 when the first women convention was organized. My text contains philosophers of feminism from 3 eras- 1792,1949 and 1981. I want to explore if the philosphy of feminism changed through errors or not.
